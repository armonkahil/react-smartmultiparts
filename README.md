## React Smart Multipart Form

npm package in progress.

The Form component accepts a list of filetypes and form fields.  

The Form 2 component allows you to specify an object containing supported file types as keys and their correspending fields as a value array.  

Using "comments" will generate a text area input, support for more input types to be added soon.

Both Forms must be passed a callback function to handle the multipart data using the "cb" prop.
